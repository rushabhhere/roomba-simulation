# Roomba Simulation

This project is made for the Reinforcement Learning course. We aim to train a Roomba, which is a vacuum cleaner robot, to clean a room as fast as possible.

If this simulation achieves good accuracy, our plan is to implement it in a real Roomba robot.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rushabhhere/roomba-simulation
```

2. Create a virtual environment

```bash
cd roomba-simulation
python3 -m venv .venv
```

3. Activate the virtual environment

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

4. Install the dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. Run the simulation

```bash
python main.py
```
